# Interactive Course Scheduler

## Overview

The Interactive Course Scheduler is a Java-based application designed to streamline the process of scheduling academic courses and events. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to add and remove courses, add events, reset schedules, handle schedule conflicts, and read/write schedule data to/from files.

## Key Features

### User-Friendly GUI

The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the scheduler. Users can view their schedules, add new courses and events, and remove existing ones with a few simple clicks.

### Conflict Resolution

The scheduler includes a conflict detection and resolution mechanism. It ensures that no two courses or events overlap in time, helping users avoid scheduling conflicts.

### File I/O

Users can save their schedules to a file and load schedules from existing files. This feature is particularly useful for students and institutions that need to keep track of schedules across multiple sessions.

### Course and Event Management

The application supports both academic courses and events. Users can add courses with details like course name, section, credit hours, instructor, meeting days, start time, and end time. Events can also be added with similar information.

### Reset Functionality

In case users want to start fresh, the scheduler includes a reset option that clears the current schedule, allowing users to build a new one from scratch.
